\textbf{How to read this document}

Depending on how you are planning on using GridPACK$\mathrm{{}^{TM}}$, there are a variety of different ways of approaching the documentation. If you are only planning on using existing applications as is, without modification, then you should focus on the sections for configuring and building GridPACK and the application module documentation. Users that interested in developing their own applications may want to scan the section ``Developing Applications'' before going to the beginning of the document to learn about individual functionality in depth. The ``GridPACK Examples'' section contains additional examples of simple applications that can be used to get a sense of how to build an application from the ground up. The ``Contingency Analysis'' section provides some information on how to build applications that are based on the existing GridPACK application modules. Users that are interested in modifying the core functionality in GridPACK can look at the Doxygen documentation online under the ``GridPACK API Documentation'' link on www.gridpack.org, in addition to the documentation in this document.
