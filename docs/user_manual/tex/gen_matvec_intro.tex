\chapter{Generalized Matrix-Vector Interface}

The matrix-vector interface described earlier is suitable for problems where the
independent and dependent variables are both associated with buses. This is
usually true for systems where Kirchhoff's law is strictly enforced. However,
this interface does not work for systems where some variables are associated
with branches. This can occur in optimization problems such as state estimation,
where measurements are made on both buses and branches. Every measurement
contributes an equation to the state-estimation optimization, which results in
dependent variables associated with branches. To handle these types of problems,
a more general approach to creating matrices and vectors is required. This is
implemented via the \texttt{\textbf{GenMatVecInterface}} class described below.
